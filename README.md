@NaomiMcQuade here
# 👋 Hi, I'm Naomi McQuade

I'm a traditional visual artist who found a new dimension through 3D software. My creative journey blends hands-on art with digital mastery—trained in tools like Softimage, 3D Studio Max, Maya, Pointstream, and designing on a Wacom tablet. I believe that the old and the new can work together to create something unique.

## 🎨 What I Do
- **Traditional art skills**: Drawing, painting, sketching—the foundation of my creative vision.
- **3D design & animation**: Years of experience with Softimage, 3D Studio Max, Maya, and more.
- **Digital illustration**: Creating on a Wacom tablet, merging tactile artistry with digital prowess.
- **Programming roots**: Originally trained in Unix, Pascal, and dBase9. Tech evolves, but curiosity remains timeless.

## 🌟 Looking for Sponsors
